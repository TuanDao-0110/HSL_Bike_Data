# Introduction
The project is to create a UI and a backend service for displaying data from journeys made with city bikes which operated by HSL bike render system in the Helsinki Capital area.
# Deployment: 

https://bike-app-2pf8.onrender.com/


# Data
For the exercise, three datasets of journey data were downloaded. The data is owned by City Bike Finland.

1. https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-05.csv
2. https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-06.csv
3. https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-07.csv

Additionally, a dataset with information about Helsinki Region Transportâ€™s (HSL) city bicycle stations was also downloaded.

# Technical details

The backend service is built using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. The data is stored in a MongoDB database, and the server is containerized using Docker. The frontend is built using React and Material UI.

# Features

The following features have been implemented:

. Data import: Data is imported from the CSV files to a MongoDB database. Data validation is performed before importing. Journeys that lasted for less than ten seconds and covered distances shorter than 10 meters are not imported.

. Journey list view: A list of journeys is displayed. Each journey shows the departure and return stations


# Running:

# User Story for Bike_App: 
1. [x] Create front end fetching station and journey data from backend. 
2. [x] Render each station location with map render.
3. [x] Show top 5 departure and arrival stations, average leaving and arrive distance.
4. [x] Languages set up include: English, Finnish, Swedish. 
5. [x] Limmit fetching journey data from back end. 
6. [x] Sorting/Filter on journey's and station's table.
7. [ ] Posting new journey/station data. 
8. [x] Create Backend Get journey/station data
9. [x] Post new station data 
10. [ ] Post new journey data

# Testing:

The tests have been written using the Jest testing framework. The tests cover the following scenarios:

1. `averageStartFromStation`

. It should return "No Data" if there are no journeys starting from the specified station.
. It should return the correct average even if journeys have different covered distances.

2. `averageEndAtStation`

. It should return the average distance covered by journeys ending at a given station.
. It should return "No Data" if no journeys end at the given station.

3. `checkValidateData`

. Departure and return times must be parseable DateTime strings.
. The arrival time must not happen before the departure time.
. Departure station ID, return station ID, and trip duration must be positive integers.

# Warning: 

1. Please consider when select fletching all data, it may web server broken.
2. In case webserver broken, please wait 15s-30s before go to website again.
